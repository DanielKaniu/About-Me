Yoh! :wave: How's it going?! 

Welcome to my space.

I am Daniel Kaniu, a developer based in the cool land of Kenya :earth_africa: (+254 is the code)

My current interest is in web development; so I play a lot with web-based programming languages, 
  e.g., HTML5 (yes! I fancy it as a programming language :relaxed:), CSS3, JAVASCRIPT/TYPESCRIPT and some bit of KOTLIN.

I am currently learning one of JavaScript's framework, I won't say which one for now. But don't you worry, I will soon make public 
  a project I'm working on.  It is based on that framework. 
  
I am also learning the art of patient living. Being patient in learning, coding and being patient in life as a whole.
