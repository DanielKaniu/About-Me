Yoh! :wave: How's it going?! 

Welcome to my space.

I am Daniel Kaniu, a developer based in the cool land of Kenya :earth_africa:

My current interest is in web development; so I play a lot with web-based technologies like Angular and Laravel 
and some bit of KOTLIN for mobile apps development.
  
I am also learning the art of patient living. Being patient in learning, coding and being patient in life as a whole.

In case you want to reach me, use my socials:

Enjoy a tour of my space.

Cheers! :baby_bottle:
